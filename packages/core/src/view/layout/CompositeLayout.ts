/**
 * Allows to compose multiple layouts into a single layout. The master layout
 * is the layout that handles move operations if another layout than the first
 * element in <layouts> should be used. The <master> layout is not executed as
 * the code assumes that it is part of <layouts>.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```javascript
 * let first = new mxFastOrganicLayout(graph);
 * let second = new mxParallelEdgeLayout(graph);
 * let layout = new mxCompositeLayout(graph, [first, second], first);
 * layout.execute(graph.getDefaultParent());
 * ```
 *
 * Constructor: mxCompositeLayout
 *
 * Constructs a new layout using the given layouts. The graph instance is
 * required for creating the transaction that contains all layouts.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *
 * graph - Reference to the enclosing <mxGraph>.
 * layouts - Array of <mxGraphLayouts>.
 * master - Optional layout that handles moves. If no layout is given then
 * the first layout of the above array is used to handle moves.
